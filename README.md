This program uses CFR to calculate the optimal strategy in Dudo. CFR traverses the game tree of information states and calculates the utility and regret for each action, and uses the regret to update its strategy in the next iteration. At the end, the optimal strategy is calculated to be the average strategy used between all iterations. The expected value of this strategy is then calculated by simulating many games, and this value is output.
